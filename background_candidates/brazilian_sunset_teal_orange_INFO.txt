Why it matches the MasterBus plugin color scheme:
------------------------------------------------
The MasterBus plugin uses a professional multi-accent color scheme:
- Primary accent: Blue (#4a9eff)
- EQ accent: Teal (#00d4aa)
- Compressor accent: Orange (#ff6b4a)
- Background: Dark (#1a1a1a)
- Text: Light (#f0f0f0)
- Meter colors: Green/Yellow/Red

This sunset landscape image features:
- Warm orange/amber tones that complement the compressor accent color
- Teal/blue sky elements matching the EQ section accent
- Professional, balanced composition suitable for a mastering plugin
- Brazilian agricultural landscape aesthetic (pampas/farmland)

Recommended usage:
- Apply with very low opacity (8-12%) to maintain professional appearance
- The horizontal composition works well with the plugin's wide layout
- Color balance provides subtle warmth without overwhelming the UI
- Enhances the plugin's "final master" polished aesthetic
